# OSMMPump
Open-Source Multichannel Microfluidics Pump. Developed as a research project to create a system that can precisely deliver fluids at a resolution of up to 0.1 uL/min. 
This project uses a RAMPS 1.4 mainboard, and 5 NEMA 14 Stepper motors to drive the pumps. A full bill of materials is available under 'OSMM Pump BOM.ods'. 
All files should be 3D printable on a well-tuned FDM printer, however, final prints for my testing were done on an SLA machine.
